3000000001	Yes, I have a lot of furniture and a lot of books.
3000000002	Oh right. I completely forgot that. Then it is probably no problem. How old are you again?
3000000003	So I can bring a couch and a washing machine.
3000000004	Yes, balloons are enough. People come to celebrate and not to eat.
3000000005	I did not think about that. How do we have to pay the rent?
3000000006	No, I do not like that, because sometimes I'm not at home.
3000000007	Yes, there are mosques in Indonesia. It is a Muslim country.
3000000008	The kitchen is very small. But we can eat in the summer on the balcony and in the winter in the living room.
3000000009	How did you forget that? That's really great and fantastic.
3000000010	I asked the landlord again and he said that we always have to transfer at the beginning of the month.
3000000011	I'm not saying anything. I'm just overwhelmed. What more can I say?
3000000012	That does not sound so good. So the others have no say.
3000000013	Why are you inviting them? I will not come. That can not be.
3000000014	Yes, the price is too expensive. I am still a student and I do not even work.
3000000015	What do we need a console for?
3000000016	You say that you are rich and then you say that you do not want to draw the attention to yourself.
3000000017	We need a hiding place. Do you know any?
3000000018	Yes, they are also available in black and yellow.
3000000019	How many square meters does the kitchen have? I have to know that.
3000000020	I think we only need a wardrobe and a mirror. Lena wants to get the things.
3000000021	I love the food in Indonesia.
3000000022	You will now promise me that you will not come, otherwise you can go to Dubai alone.
3000000023	Yes, I think so too. I have never been there.
3000000024	But I can not change it anymore. I am really sorry.
3000000025	Of course, they are very important. I will get the rest. Lena does almost nothing.
3000000026	How long is the lesson? As you know, I am a medical student and will soon have my first exam.
3000000027	No, that was just too shallow. I thought it was true.
3000000028	I think your suggestion is great. You are really creative.
3000000029	I would like to go to a mosque and to the beach. I want to eat a lot.
3000000030	If you want I can also cook every Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
3000000031	Okay, I agree with that. Is there anything left to discuss?
3000000032	So I still have five pots and a kettle. Do you have glasses and knives?
3000000033	I want to go there, too. Lisa lives there now, right?
3000000034	The kitchen is 15 square meters. That's okay.
3000000035	Under the mat in front of the door? Do you agree?
3000000036	Then we will not go to Australia. What was the logic behind it?
3000000037	We can also invite Nirvana to sing for us.
3000000038	He has a lot of companies and is working in the field of cars.
3000000039	The hall is half an hour away from us. The boat is a better idea.
3000000040	No, you know that Lena is a rock fan. You have to rent it in black.
3000000041	Now I'm relieved. Do you have a bike?
3000000042	The flight lasts 12 hours.
3000000043	The apartment has three rooms, the house would be enough for us.
3000000044	Yes, should I get the cleaning products?
3000000045	Yes, I always get holidays. I love holidays.
3000000046	Then he probably had an important conversation. That's all possible.
3000000047	I will not do that. Tell me what you want to see in Dubai.
3000000048	Where is the hall? I thought about celebrating it on a boat.
3000000049	I did a lot of research and my dad worked there as well.
3000000051	I'm not sure. In which city do you live? I've forgotten it.
3000000052	I was in the desert and I saw a lot of stars and it was very cold. You have to go there, too.
3000000053	No, our neighbors would not agree with that.
3000000054	No, of course I do not have a bike. Why do you ask?
3000000055	In my opinion, we also need black cutlery.
3000000056	Would a small closet for our utensils fit?
3000000057	We want to move after two weeks.
3000000058	Then buy a white and black door.
3000000059	No, he is even cleaner and more hygienic than me. He makes himself clean.
3000000060	Do you agree with what I just wrote?
3000000061	I think we should buy black balloons.
3000000062	What would it be, for example?
3000000063	Were you in Turkey? I want to go there.
3000000064	I think the idea is great. Who pays for the helicopter?
3000000065	Then you're still under 18 and you'll have to ask your parents if you're allowed to come with us.
3000000066	Which country do you want to travel to? That would be interesting.
3000000067	I would take cheese skewers and small snacks.
3000000068	Lena has more furniture than you. Is it okay for you to put her posters in your room?
3000000069	I do not believe that now. You have to explain it to me.
3000000070	Then you can not come. Honestly, I do not feel like it anymore.
3000000071	Yes, her mother will sew it for us. Which color do you want?
3000000072	Do we want to demonstrate against it? So that we may wear short pants.
3000000073	Yes, I would be very happy about that. That's a real talent.
3000000074	Yes, that's okay. I'm really looking forward to it. Have you already moved?
3000000075	Yes, I'm a bit forgetful. Where do we get moving boxes?
3000000076	What color does the front door have and does the apartment have underfloor heating?
3000000077	I do not know when and where I want to spend it.
3000000078	You just have too many prejudices. You have not broadened your horizons.
3000000079	I've never been to Indonesia. Let's fly to Indonesia.
3000000080	Why do you know so much about the family? That surprises me.
3000000081	But I want to fly in the morning.
3000000082	That's good. What time do we want to start? I still have a good idea.
3000000083	How did you settle it with the registration office? Did you just go there?
3000000084	I'm proud of you that you can handle your forgetfulness.
3000000085	So my dear have you ever heard of a university? I am just in my last year.
3000000086	How many times do I have to tell you? We will do it systematically. Can you please answer my question?
3000000087	They are punks. What can you do with the family? I'd be very interested in that.
3000000088	That's not a problem. You get everything you want. Do not worry.
3000000089	Lena is afraid of cats. But I can talk to her if you want that.
3000000090	Yes, tell me. How was it there?
3000000091	Everyone can go shopping for a week. I go in the first week.
3000000093	How do we want to do that with the other rooms? We can alternate every week.
3000000094	I almost died once because I forgot to breathe when I was in the water.
3000000095	That's good. I also live in Hamburg. How tall is the house?
3000000096	I would choose rock music.
3000000097	Of course they drink alcohol and they eat everything.
3000000098	So Lena will bring a TV. What do you want to bring?
3000000099	Yes, he has influenced her negatively. I can not believe it either.
3000000100	We clean up here and then we move in.
3000000101	Those who want to stay overnight must pay. Then we would not have any problems.
3000000102	I think there is a dishwasher in the apartment. Shall I ask?
3000000103	Yes, black make-up must not be missing. How should the decorations look?
3000000104	Yes, that would work. How many cats do you have?
3000000105	Yes, I agree. Is that okay for Lisa to move in with you?
3000000106	I do not have to accept anything. Dubai is not a free country.
3000000107	Please stay calm. We are not done with the kitchen yet. Do we want to place the dining table in the kitchen?
3000000108	I will take clothes and toiletries with me.
3000000109	Really? I also wanted to go there two years ago.
3000000110	How many places are in the helicopter?
3000000111	I also love the food in Indonesia. There you are not alone.
3000000112	No, I will not move in this way. That's too risky for me.
3000000113	That's too much work. In addition, Lena and I have no desire.
3000000114	I think we should divide the sum by three and then everyone can pay a part.
3000000115	I almost died. I was also in the Opera House.
3000000116	I mean the door should be black and white. You should not buy two doors.
3000000117	Lena can cook Wednesday and Thursday. I'm just cooking for three days.
3000000118	We have to tell everyone that they have to bring a present.
3000000119	My dad says we will fly around 6:00 pm.
3000000120	it's a good idea. Will you bring me?
3000000121	I was there for four months. It was a great time.
3000000122	No, there is still a lot missing. What is our address? We still have to change it.
3000000123	I know Dubai very well, although I've never been there.
3000000124	No, we are rich and we have the pillows with us. It is a first-class helicopter.
3000000125	How long does the flight actually take?
3000000126	No, I do not like that, because otherwise everything is black.
3000000127	That's terrible. I want to color it white. Would it be okay for you?
3000000128	I still have a kettle and toaster. I can also get a fridge. What can you get?
3000000129	I like that. Now we have everything planned. How much is the rent?
3000000130	Of course I'm serious. Please count them down, otherwise I will not go with them anymore.
3000000131	I think that's great. Finally she does something too. I hope I will get along with you.
3000000132	We have everything planned now. The problem is how we will transport everything.
3000000133	That's very interesting. I love it.
3000000134	But they drink alcohol and what would they eat?
3000000135	That's not our topic now. Where were you last summer?
3000000136	Then we keep the cat away from her. That should work.
3000000137	I mean on the wall. He does not want holes to be in the wall later.
3000000138	I was in Germany. I have not done anything interesting.
3000000139	Do you want to draw attention now? For me, it does not matter.
3000000140	Yes, but let's make it another day when we clean the whole house.
3000000141	Okay, but I want the furniture in the living room to be yellow and dark blue.
3000000142	The landlord does not want us to hang something on the wall.
3000000143	I do not want to paint all the walls. My room should not be dyed.
3000000144	Lena, just told me that she can also bring a TV.
3000000145	I like that. Most animals are dirty.
3000000146	I would like to take over the kitchen service.
3000000147	Lena wants to vacuum and wipe. We have already clarified the services.
3000000148	No, I remembered that my father has a moving company. He can do that.
3000000149	Should everyone dress the same? I think that's a very good idea.
3000000150	We could spend the night on the boat, too.
3000000151	I hope so. I'm looking forward to. That has always been my dream.
3000000152	I do not have a fridge either. Let's make a plan who has to buy or take something.
3000000153	Who does not love holidays? Since I am the boss, I can plan my vacation myself.
3000000154	I would like to go to New Zealand. I am very fascinated.
3000000155	Yes, that would be good. What color is the kitchen?
3000000156	Yes, that would be a suggestion. It's better than nothing.
3000000157	After two months we have holidays again.
3000000158	I live in Hamburg. I will move to an apartment with Lena.
3000000159	You do not have to say anything anymore. How many bottles of cola should I get?
3000000160	I spontaneously came up with something. We can fly with my helicopter. Then we do not have to pay for airline tickets.
3000000161	Yes, but only two days. There was a lot of fun. In Sydney it is very expensive.
3000000162	I'm 25. What time are we flying?
3000000163	I have a Persian cat. His name is Tom.
3000000164	Should we make black make-up?
3000000165	You will cook Monday and Tuesday. Do you agree?
3000000166	Okay, that's good. Then it is cheap.
3000000167	When do we want to do it? The university will start in three weeks.
3000000168	Then please search for cheap hotels. Why is Lena coming?
3000000169	But you have to take your fridge, because we both have no fridge. It's okay for Lena.
3000000170	Yes, he was on his smartphone?
3000000171	What will you take with you for Dubai?
3000000172	Will you fly back to America?
3000000173	It may be that he did not see you. At the moment he might be busy.
3000000174	Lena wants to buy a curtain. She also has a container for toothpaste and toothbrushes.
3000000175	That's not serious, right? I can not list all.
3000000176	I learned to surf in Australia. Everything is possible there too.
3000000177	That's great. If you want, I can get the curtains.
3000000178	Were you in Sydney, too?
3000000179	Why? I can go on vacation anywhere. Can you swim there as a woman?
3000000180	We have three bedrooms. Everyone gets their own bedroom.
3000000181	Yes, you are right. How do we want to do that?
3000000182	Then it is like this. When did we want to move again? I've forgotten it.
3000000183	But I'm afraid of the family, because the family is a bit brutal.
3000000184	We will do that. For the kitchen we need first a fridge, an oven, a microwave and a toaster.
3000000185	No Lisa lives in Washington. We can go there too.
3000000186	I really want to go to Indonesia. There is also Bali.
3000000187	No, but I do not think it's alright that the apartment has no front door. I will buy one.
3000000188	Great, but I want to fly in the evening.
3000000189	That's not a serious question, is it? I also live in Germany.
3000000190	You do not know them personally and it has to be an American star.
3000000191	I have a few questions about that. Where do you want to put the piano?
3000000192	I also want to go to Australia. I saw kangaroos there.
3000000193	Have we already clarified everything? Do you have another question?
3000000194	I think that's better, too. It looks happier.
3000000195	Lena likes all very much. We have to endure that for Lena. We are her best friends.
3000000196	Did you live in a palace at your parents' house?
3000000197	But you have to. If you do not agree, you can fly alone.
3000000198	When do we want to meet for cleaning? Please tell Lena too. And what if someone breaks in?
3000000199	Should we buy some food?
3000000200	I had a teacher who taught me that.
3000000201	Yes, I agree. Everyone should iron their clothes.
3000000202	That was a flat joke. You probably had to laugh. It was funny.
3000000203	Does she have any illnesses? I am very sensitive.
3000000204	That's good, otherwise we would have to pay for the bike rack.
3000000205	Yes, I live in Germany. Where do you actually live?
3000000206	Do you have many clothes and lots of furniture?
3000000207	No, my dad can not fly in the evening. In the summer it is dangerous.
3000000208	I was in Sudan with my dad. There we met Tom.
3000000209	You should not go to Dubai for a holiday.
3000000210	I had pasta for dinner. We can do the same together in the summer.
3000000211	That sounds interesting. Should I tell you where I was? You will not believe it.
3000000212	Why? Do not tell me that you find the price too expensive.
3000000213	But I know Helene Fischer, she will invite me too.
3000000214	20 people fit in the boat. I think that's a good bargain.
3000000215	We are very good friends with Sophie and Julia. They are both really nice and good.
3000000216	I would like to put it in the living room.
3000000217	I will give a student piano lessons every Thursday, would that be a problem for you?
3000000218	No, I have never been to Turkey. I'm not interested in that either.
3000000219	Yes, honestly I'm still thinking. Maybe I will fly there in the winter.
3000000220	Hello, Lena has her birthday on Monday. We still have to plan everything.
3000000221	Nothing, because it is a short trip. We would return in a week.
3000000222	I like that. That's fair for everyone.
3000000223	We can maybe rent a truck.
3000000224	That would be an option too. Can you please answer my previous question?
3000000225	Thanks, that's me too. Do we want to paint all the walls?
3000000226	No, is it a punk family? How many people are there?
3000000227	I also hope that you will get along. I think we will understand each other very well.
3000000228	Get 30 boxes of Coke and Fanta. That would be enough.
3000000229	Is there a mosque there?
3000000230	We do not do that. Do not worry. We still have to think about the hallway.
3000000231	Steffi, I'm really sorry about that.
3000000232	Yes, I will stay next to you every day, otherwise you will not come with me.
3000000233	You also have to teach me. What did you have to eat in Australia?
3000000234	I love Muslim countries. Turkey is also very interesting.
3000000235	Are you serious? What are you studying anyway? I have to know that now.
3000000236	Yeah, do we want to dye them white too? So that it does not get boring, we could later plant herbs in the kitchen.
3000000237	But I do not want to fly with your father. He always asks for my grades.
3000000238	It will be great if we have three girls living together. No, we have not moved yet.
3000000239	Should I take something to eat?
3000000240	Hello, would you like to move into an apartment with us?
3000000241	Your father has a moving company.
3000000242	The living room is actually very big. I think it has 20 square meters. We will spend very little time there anyway.
3000000243	No, I do not have a car. Please ask Lena. Maybe she has one.
3000000244	But that is against human dignity. I can not say yes to that.
3000000245	That's my own helicopter. I do not have to pay anything for that. My dad is a pilot and he can get us there quickly.
3000000246	We are of the same opinion. Actually, Lena has only punk friends, right? Then we would not set a dress code.
3000000247	Just buy what you want. I want you to stop bitching now.
3000000248	No, I got an invitation from Dwayne Johnson. You can not get in there. I'm sorry.
3000000249	I think we do not need a microwave.
3000000250	Yes, but not more. That is very small. Should I buy the cabinet?
3000000251	You did not answer my question. I am for a rock and punk concept.
3000000252	Yes, you are right. She only has punk friends.
3000000253	I was in Chicago. I was also in the prison where Prison Break was filmed.
3000000254	No, but if you forget your key, what happens?
3000000255	They know a lot about cars. We can talk about cars and organize a car show.
3000000256	I do not want Tom to make the apartment dirty.
3000000257	That's really great. Our bathroom is very small and there is no window. Is it a problem for you?
3000000258	Yes, you are right. At the moment I can not think anymore. I'm so sorry.
3000000259	We should keep the decoration as simple as possible. I honestly have no desire to spend a lot of money. I think balloons are enough.
3000000260	No, Lena only has contact with the family. She even likes the family more than her own family.
3000000261	Yes, that's a good idea. Who will shop? Do we want to introduce a service for this?
3000000262	I have been to Turkey before. It is very nice there.
3000000263	Can women also eat and drink or talk to people? You know it well.
3000000264	Could you maybe do it in the balcony? I would be grateful for that.
3000000265	Because she's my best friend. Do you have a problem with her?
3000000266	I like that. Now we can start from the kitchen. What do we need for the kitchen?
3000000267	Can you walk around with a pair of shorts?
3000000268	I did not know that. I also want to go to Turkey.
3000000269	I met Tim. This is the twin brother of Tom. He had not seen me.
3000000270	But you do not stay next to us every day.
3000000271	Are you alright? Please be reasonable.
3000000272	That's too dangerous. I would like to get to know the family better. Tell more about.
3000000273	Yes, Nirvana can sing very well. Can you contact her please?
3000000274	You say that yourself. I'm sorry. But I'm richer and I'm not saying that.
3000000275	No, I will buy a dark blue. I can decide it.
3000000276	Oh right. Look, I forgot it again. What a shame.
3000000277	Yes, I would like to know where you were.
3000000278	We will discuss that later. Can Lena please get the curtains?
3000000279	I have a question. Do not you live in Germany?
3000000280	We want to move in after three days. Do you agree?
3000000281	Lena will get a bucket and three sponges.
3000000282	That's just awful. I am already curious. How did Lena get to know them?
3000000283	You can also fly to America in the spring. I was there in spring too.
3000000284	Yes, I think so, too. We can also use something blue.
3000000285	Oh, how long have you been there?
3000000286	No, that's 20 minutes away, but we can go by train.
3000000287	You are right. I find it unnecessary for the guests to bring food.
3000000288	How do we divide up the rooms? I want to have the big room.
3000000289	I totally understand your situation.
3000000290	It is probably a very successful family. I would not have thought that.
3000000291	Okay, we can plan that again. But I can not promise.
3000000292	Yes, you are right. What do we want to do with the family?
3000000293	I do not have a car. Do you have a car?
3000000294	I do not think so. Are you lying?
3000000295	Is the landlord stupid? Should everyone watch us or what?
3000000296	That's great and I was on the red carpet in Hollywood.
3000000297	Our pizza is on the way!
3000000298	Yes, that was only for a short time. I wanted to try something new.
3000000299	We can start at eight o'clock. What is your idea?
3000000300	Why didn't you come today?
