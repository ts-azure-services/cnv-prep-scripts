1	Yes, I have a lot of furniture and a lot of books.
2	Oh right. I completely forgot that. Then it is probably no problem. How old are you again?
3	So I can bring a couch and a washing machine.
4	Yes, balloons are enough. People come to celebrate and not to eat.
5	I did not think about that. How do we have to pay the rent?
6	No, I do not like that, because sometimes I'm not at home.
7	Yes, there are mosques in Indonesia. It is a Muslim country.
8	The kitchen is very small. But we can eat in the summer on the balcony and in the winter in the living room.
9	How did you forget that? That's really great and fantastic.
10	I asked the landlord again and he said that we always have to transfer at the beginning of the month.
11	I'm not saying anything. I'm just overwhelmed. What more can I say?
12	That does not sound so good. So the others have no say.
13	Why are you inviting them? I will not come. That can not be.
14	Yes, the price is too expensive. I am still a student and I do not even work.
15	What do we need a console for?
16	You say that you are rich and then you say that you do not want to draw the attention to yourself.
17	We need a hiding place. Do you know any?
18	Yes, they are also available in black and yellow.
19	How many square meters does the kitchen have? I have to know that.
20	I think we only need a wardrobe and a mirror. Lena wants to get the things.
21	I love the food in Indonesia.
22	You will now promise me that you will not come, otherwise you can go to Dubai alone.
23	Yes, I think so too. I have never been there.
24	But I can not change it anymore. I am really sorry.
25	Of course, they are very important. I will get the rest. Lena does almost nothing.
26	How long is the lesson? As you know, I am a medical student and will soon have my first exam.
27	No, that was just too shallow. I thought it was true.
28	I think your suggestion is great. You are really creative.
29	I would like to go to a mosque and to the beach. I want to eat a lot.
30	If you want I can also cook every Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
31	Okay, I agree with that. Is there anything left to discuss?
32	So I still have five pots and a kettle. Do you have glasses and knives?
33	I want to go there, too. Lisa lives there now, right?
34	The kitchen is 15 square meters. That's okay.
35	Under the mat in front of the door? Do you agree?
36	Then we will not go to Australia. What was the logic behind it?
37	We can also invite Nirvana to sing for us.
38	He has a lot of companies and is working in the field of cars.
39	The hall is half an hour away from us. The boat is a better idea.
40	No, you know that Lena is a rock fan. You have to rent it in black.
41	Now I'm relieved. Do you have a bike?
42	The flight lasts 12 hours.
43	The apartment has three rooms, the house would be enough for us.
44	Yes, should I get the cleaning products?
45	Yes, I always get holidays. I love holidays.
46	Then he probably had an important conversation. That's all possible.
47	I will not do that. Tell me what you want to see in Dubai.
48	Where is the hall? I thought about celebrating it on a boat.
49	I did a lot of research and my dad worked there as well.
50	I'm not sure. In which city do you live? I've forgotten it.
51	I was in the desert and I saw a lot of stars and it was very cold. You have to go there, too.
52	No, our neighbors would not agree with that.
53	No, of course I do not have a bike. Why do you ask?
54	In my opinion, we also need black cutlery.
55	Would a small closet for our utensils fit?
56	We want to move after two weeks.
57	Then buy a white and black door.
58	No, he is even cleaner and more hygienic than me. He makes himself clean.
59	Do you agree with what I just wrote?
60	I think we should buy black balloons.
61	What would it be, for example?
62	Were you in Turkey? I want to go there.
63	I think the idea is great. Who pays for the helicopter?
64	Then you're still under 18 and you'll have to ask your parents if you're allowed to come with us.
65	Which country do you want to travel to? That would be interesting.
66	I would take cheese skewers and small snacks.
67	Lena has more furniture than you. Is it okay for you to put her posters in your room?
68	I do not believe that now. You have to explain it to me.
69	Then you can not come. Honestly, I do not feel like it anymore.
70	Yes, her mother will sew it for us. Which color do you want?
71	Do we want to demonstrate against it? So that we may wear short pants.
72	Yes, I would be very happy about that. That's a real talent.
73	Yes, that's okay. I'm really looking forward to it. Have you already moved?
74	Yes, I'm a bit forgetful. Where do we get moving boxes?
75	What color does the front door have and does the apartment have underfloor heating?
76	I do not know when and where I want to spend it.
77	You just have too many prejudices. You have not broadened your horizons.
78	I've never been to Indonesia. Let's fly to Indonesia.
79	Why do you know so much about the family? That surprises me.
80	But I want to fly in the morning.
81	That's good. What time do we want to start? I still have a good idea.
82	How did you settle it with the registration office? Did you just go there?
83	I'm proud of you that you can handle your forgetfulness.
84	So my dear have you ever heard of a university? I am just in my last year.
85	How many times do I have to tell you? We will do it systematically. Can you please answer my question?
86	They are punks. What can you do with the family? I'd be very interested in that.
87	That's not a problem. You get everything you want. Do not worry.
88	Lena is afraid of cats. But I can talk to her if you want that.
89	Yes, tell me. How was it there?
90	Everyone can go shopping for a week. I go in the first week.
91	How do we want to do that with the other rooms? We can alternate every week.
92	I almost died once because I forgot to breathe when I was in the water.
93	That's good. I also live in Hamburg. How tall is the house?
94	I would choose rock music.
95	Of course they drink alcohol and they eat everything.
96	So Lena will bring a TV. What do you want to bring?
97	Yes, he has influenced her negatively. I can not believe it either.
98	We clean up here and then we move in.
99	Those who want to stay overnight must pay. Then we would not have any problems.
100	I think there is a dishwasher in the apartment. Shall I ask?
101	Yes, black make-up must not be missing. How should the decorations look?
102	Yes, that would work. How many cats do you have?
103	Yes, I agree. Is that okay for Lisa to move in with you?
104	I do not have to accept anything. Dubai is not a free country.
105	Please stay calm. We are not done with the kitchen yet. Do we want to place the dining table in the kitchen?
106	I will take clothes and toiletries with me.
107	Really? I also wanted to go there two years ago.
108	How many places are in the helicopter?
109	I also love the food in Indonesia. There you are not alone.
110	No, I will not move in this way. That's too risky for me.
111	That's too much work. In addition, Lena and I have no desire.
112	I think we should divide the sum by three and then everyone can pay a part.
113	I almost died. I was also in the Opera House.
114	I mean the door should be black and white. You should not buy two doors.
115	Lena can cook Wednesday and Thursday. I'm just cooking for three days.
116	We have to tell everyone that they have to bring a present.
117	My dad says we will fly around 6:00 pm.
118	it's a good idea. Will you bring me?
119	I was there for four months. It was a great time.
120	No, there is still a lot missing. What is our address? We still have to change it.
121	I know Dubai very well, although I've never been there.
122	No, we are rich and we have the pillows with us. It is a first-class helicopter.
123	How long does the flight actually take?
124	No, I do not like that, because otherwise everything is black.
125	That's terrible. I want to color it white. Would it be okay for you?
126	I still have a kettle and toaster. I can also get a fridge. What can you get?
127	I like that. Now we have everything planned. How much is the rent?
128	Of course I'm serious. Please count them down, otherwise I will not go with them anymore.
129	I think that's great. Finally she does something too. I hope I will get along with you.
130	We have everything planned now. The problem is how we will transport everything.
131	That's very interesting. I love it.
132	But they drink alcohol and what would they eat?
133	That's not our topic now. Where were you last summer?
134	Then we keep the cat away from her. That should work.
135	I mean on the wall. He does not want holes to be in the wall later.
136	I was in Germany. I have not done anything interesting.
137	Do you want to draw attention now? For me, it does not matter.
138	Yes, but let's make it another day when we clean the whole house.
139	Okay, but I want the furniture in the living room to be yellow and dark blue.
140	The landlord does not want us to hang something on the wall.
141	I do not want to paint all the walls. My room should not be dyed.
142	Lena, just told me that she can also bring a TV.
143	I like that. Most animals are dirty.
144	I would like to take over the kitchen service.
145	Lena wants to vacuum and wipe. We have already clarified the services.
146	No, I remembered that my father has a moving company. He can do that.
147	Should everyone dress the same? I think that's a very good idea.
148	We could spend the night on the boat, too.
149	I hope so. I'm looking forward to. That has always been my dream.
150	I do not have a fridge either. Let's make a plan who has to buy or take something.
151	Who does not love holidays? Since I am the boss, I can plan my vacation myself.
152	I would like to go to New Zealand. I am very fascinated.
153	Yes, that would be good. What color is the kitchen?
154	Yes, that would be a suggestion. It's better than nothing.
155	After two months we have holidays again.
156	I live in Hamburg. I will move to an apartment with Lena.
157	You do not have to say anything anymore. How many bottles of cola should I get?
158	I spontaneously came up with something. We can fly with my helicopter. Then we do not have to pay for airline tickets.
159	Yes, but only two days. There was a lot of fun. In Sydney it is very expensive.
160	I'm 25. What time are we flying?
161	I have a Persian cat. His name is Tom.
162	Should we make black make-up?
163	You will cook Monday and Tuesday. Do you agree?
164	Okay, that's good. Then it is cheap.
165	When do we want to do it? The university will start in three weeks.
166	Then please search for cheap hotels. Why is Lena coming?
167	But you have to take your fridge, because we both have no fridge. It's okay for Lena.
168	Yes, he was on his smartphone?
169	What will you take with you for Dubai?
170	Will you fly back to America?
171	It may be that he did not see you. At the moment he might be busy.
172	Lena wants to buy a curtain. She also has a container for toothpaste and toothbrushes.
173	That's not serious, right? I can not list all.
174	I learned to surf in Australia. Everything is possible there too.
175	That's great. If you want, I can get the curtains.
176	Were you in Sydney, too?
177	Why? I can go on vacation anywhere. Can you swim there as a woman?
178	We have three bedrooms. Everyone gets their own bedroom.
179	Yes, you are right. How do we want to do that?
180	Then it is like this. When did we want to move again? I've forgotten it.
181	But I'm afraid of the family, because the family is a bit brutal.
182	We will do that. For the kitchen we need first a fridge, an oven, a microwave and a toaster.
183	No Lisa lives in Washington. We can go there too.
184	I really want to go to Indonesia. There is also Bali.
185	No, but I do not think it's alright that the apartment has no front door. I will buy one.
186	Great, but I want to fly in the evening.
187	That's not a serious question, is it? I also live in Germany.
188	You do not know them personally and it has to be an American star.
189	I have a few questions about that. Where do you want to put the piano?
190	I also want to go to Australia. I saw kangaroos there.
191	Have we already clarified everything? Do you have another question?
192	I think that's better, too. It looks happier.
193	Lena likes all very much. We have to endure that for Lena. We are her best friends.
194	Did you live in a palace at your parents' house?
195	But you have to. If you do not agree, you can fly alone.
196	When do we want to meet for cleaning? Please tell Lena too. And what if someone breaks in?
197	Should we buy some food?
198	I had a teacher who taught me that.
199	Yes, I agree. Everyone should iron their clothes.
200	That was a flat joke. You probably had to laugh. It was funny.
201	Does she have any illnesses? I am very sensitive.
202	That's good, otherwise we would have to pay for the bike rack.
203	Yes, I live in Germany. Where do you actually live?
204	Do you have many clothes and lots of furniture?
205	No, my dad can not fly in the evening. In the summer it is dangerous.
206	I was in Sudan with my dad. There we met Tom.
207	You should not go to Dubai for a holiday.
208	I had pasta for dinner. We can do the same together in the summer.
209	That sounds interesting. Should I tell you where I was? You will not believe it.
210	Why? Do not tell me that you find the price too expensive.
211	But I know Helene Fischer, she will invite me too.
212	20 people fit in the boat. I think that's a good bargain.
213	We are very good friends with Sophie and Julia. They are both really nice and good.
214	I would like to put it in the living room.
215	I will give a student piano lessons every Thursday, would that be a problem for you?
216	No, I have never been to Turkey. I'm not interested in that either.
217	Yes, honestly I'm still thinking. Maybe I will fly there in the winter.
218	Hello, Lena has her birthday on Monday. We still have to plan everything.
219	Nothing, because it is a short trip. We would return in a week.
220	I like that. That's fair for everyone.
221	We can maybe rent a truck.
222	That would be an option too. Can you please answer my previous question?
223	Thanks, that's me too. Do we want to paint all the walls?
224	No, is it a punk family? How many people are there?
225	I also hope that you will get along. I think we will understand each other very well.
226	Get 30 boxes of Coke and Fanta. That would be enough.
227	Is there a mosque there?
228	We do not do that. Do not worry. We still have to think about the hallway.
229	Steffi, I'm really sorry about that.
230	Yes, I will stay next to you every day, otherwise you will not come with me.
231	You also have to teach me. What did you have to eat in Australia?
232	I love Muslim countries. Turkey is also very interesting.
233	Are you serious? What are you studying anyway? I have to know that now.
234	Yeah, do we want to dye them white too? So that it does not get boring, we could later plant herbs in the kitchen.
235	But I do not want to fly with your father. He always asks for my grades.
236	It will be great if we have three girls living together. No, we have not moved yet.
237	Should I take something to eat?
238	Hello, would you like to move into an apartment with us?
239	Your father has a moving company.
240	The living room is actually very big. I think it has 20 square meters. We will spend very little time there anyway.
241	No, I do not have a car. Please ask Lena. Maybe she has one.
242	But that is against human dignity. I can not say yes to that.
243	That's my own helicopter. I do not have to pay anything for that. My dad is a pilot and he can get us there quickly.
244	We are of the same opinion. Actually, Lena has only punk friends, right? Then we would not set a dress code.
245	Just buy what you want. I want you to stop bitching now.
246	No, I got an invitation from Dwayne Johnson. You can not get in there. I'm sorry.
247	I think we do not need a microwave.
248	Yes, but not more. That is very small. Should I buy the cabinet?
249	You did not answer my question. I am for a rock and punk concept.
250	Yes, you are right. She only has punk friends.
251	I was in Chicago. I was also in the prison where Prison Break was filmed.
252	No, but if you forget your key, what happens?
253	They know a lot about cars. We can talk about cars and organize a car show.
254	I do not want Tom to make the apartment dirty.
255	That's really great. Our bathroom is very small and there is no window. Is it a problem for you?
256	Yes, you are right. At the moment I can not think anymore. I'm so sorry.
257	We should keep the decoration as simple as possible. I honestly have no desire to spend a lot of money. I think balloons are enough.
258	No, Lena only has contact with the family. She even likes the family more than her own family.
259	Yes, that's a good idea. Who will shop? Do we want to introduce a service for this?
260	I have been to Turkey before. It is very nice there.
261	Can women also eat and drink or talk to people? You know it well.
262	Could you maybe do it in the balcony? I would be grateful for that.
263	Because she's my best friend. Do you have a problem with her?
264	I like that. Now we can start from the kitchen. What do we need for the kitchen?
265	Can you walk around with a pair of shorts?
266	I did not know that. I also want to go to Turkey.
267	I met Tim. This is the twin brother of Tom. He had not seen me.
268	But you do not stay next to us every day.
269	Are you alright? Please be reasonable.
270	That's too dangerous. I would like to get to know the family better. Tell more about.
271	Yes, Nirvana can sing very well. Can you contact her please?
272	You say that yourself. I'm sorry. But I'm richer and I'm not saying that.
273	No, I will buy a dark blue. I can decide it.
274	Oh right. Look, I forgot it again. What a shame.
275	Yes, I would like to know where you were.
276	We will discuss that later. Can Lena please get the curtains?
277	I have a question. Do not you live in Germany?
278	We want to move in after three days. Do you agree?
279	Lena will get a bucket and three sponges.
280	That's just awful. I am already curious. How did Lena get to know them?
281	You can also fly to America in the spring. I was there in spring too.
282	Yes, I think so, too. We can also use something blue.
283	Oh, how long have you been there?
284	No, that's 20 minutes away, but we can go by train.
285	You are right. I find it unnecessary for the guests to bring food.
286	How do we divide up the rooms? I want to have the big room.
287	I totally understand your situation.
288	It is probably a very successful family. I would not have thought that.
289	Okay, we can plan that again. But I can not promise.
290	Yes, you are right. What do we want to do with the family?
291	I do not have a car. Do you have a car?
292	I do not think so. Are you lying?
293	Is the landlord stupid? Should everyone watch us or what?
294	That's great and I was on the red carpet in Hollywood.
295	Our pizza is on the way!
296	Yes, that was only for a short time. I wanted to try something new.
297	We can start at eight o'clock. What is your idea?
298	Why didn't you come today?
